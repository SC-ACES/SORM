												The forces system is a new system being implemented to organize official missions. This system is an overall organizational idea that has been discussed and refined by our members, and will be used by the Council to organize official missions in the Star Citizen universe. The council will use this system to help create official missions to maximize ACES resources and enhance the in-game experience of our members.
												<br><br>
												The forces system uses our established division, squadron, commitment, and Councilor officer system to organize ten forces that will assist with coordinating these official missions. These forces will be rolled out in stages as the game nears completion, and the officers are being renamed to force commanders to help clarify their role.
												<br><br>
												The Council recently defined an official mission as follows:
												<br><br>
												<span class="quote">“An official mission is a mission sanctioned by ACES, in which ACES gets a portion of the profits. Squadrons will only be required to fly together during Official Missions.”</span>
												<br><br>
												After clarifying this, and taking into consideration the input of our players, we believe that this model will work best for everyone. When players and squadrons are interested in joining an official mission, they will work with the Council, their squadrons and other members within the following proposed structure:
												<br><br>
												Proposed Official Mission Forces (aka: “OMFs” or “Forces”)
												Each OMF has a Force Commander (aka: “FC” or “Commander”) to coordinate operations and ensure balance.

												<span style="color:#CB2E27">**</span></th> Mission distribution system will be a job board or similar style system used to send out official missions that require less oversight from commanders or the council. A majority of missions going through a mission board or a similar system would likely only require a small group of members or a small number of squadrons. Whatever this system ends up being in the game, the council and the commanders will work with all members to ensure it is fair.

											<li>You pick one division (Capitalist, Explorer or Soldier) for your squadron to fall under.</li>
											<li>Squadrons will identify with one of two "commitment levels," either standard commitment or high commitment. (High commitment squadrons do not necessarily indicate higher skill, and, likewise, standard commitment does not indicate a lower level of skill. A squadron’s commitment indicates the squadron members’ overall level of interest in participation on official missions. Commitment levels will help the council organize missions to be as successful as possible.)</li>
											<li>It can do any mixture of roles you want.</li>
											<li>It can be inclusive of whatever timezones you think work best.</li>
											<li>Minimum squadron size is 5 members.</li>
											<li>Squadrons with less than 5 members are Probationary Squadrons. They don't officially have any members, and don't participate in Official Missions.</li>
											<li>Once a squadron has more than 5 members, it becomes an Active Squadron. All members on the squadron's probationary roster are immediately moved from their previous Active Squadron to the new squadron.</li>
											<li>Members can only be a member of one Active Squadron but may fly with and participate with any other squadron or member at anytime in accordance with member Squadron rules.</li>

												<li>Councillors can appoint any officer they want to help them perform their duties. These officers can only be vetoed by the Councillor's counterpart.</li>

Should users desire to become an admin, they can apply in this section of the forum, where the council will review them and accept them should we believe them to be a good fit. The application will include basic questions such as the applicant's experience with Teamspeak, his history with any type of similar duties in other games/orgs, and why he feels he's a good fit for joining the TS mod team. The sitting council can also remove a TS admin at their discretion at any time, should a majority agree to do so.<sup class="footNote"><a href="http://www.starcitizenaces.org/forum/page/4/m/11393875/viewthread/7131235-council-decisions/post/107690152#p107690152"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></sup></li>

								<li>The Council has the authority to create various committees that handle various "meta" tasks the leadership of ACES has to contend with. These are different from normal squadrons because the tasks they carry out are not in-game, but rather web-based activities.</li>
								<li>They will advise the council in their respective specialities, and will assist the Council in carrying out the requests they are given.</li>
								<li>They are appointed by the Council and can be added or removed at will, however outside of that they hold the position indefinitely (allowing them to pass knowledge between Councils).</li>
								<li>All of the committees with the exception of the CC are lead by a "Director" of that particular committee who manages the committee's various tasks and reports to the council.</li>
								<ol class="noListStyle">
									<li><span class="alphaOrderedListTitle">Administrative Committee</span><br>
										Includes website admins and teamspeak admins, with one Director of Administration to manage the admins. Their responsibilities include managing the setup of the teamspeak server and the website, making changes when requested by the council. They also maintain a quasi-moderator role by being able to issue strikes on their respective mediums (website and teamspeak), but do not mediate conflicts like the CC.
									</li>
									<li><span class="alphaOrderedListTitle">Conflict Committee</span>
										<ol class="romanLower">
											<li>The Conflict Committee is responsible for keeping the peace within ACES in the most discreet manner possible. The committee is made up of 6 members.</li>
											<li>It's roles include being moderators of both the forums and teamspeak, and mediating conflicts between ACES members.</li>
											<li>Since each Councillor represents 1 division, it's very likely that a Councillor will appoint someone who primarily operates within their division. This could be because the Councillor really only knows people they've flown missions with, or because of some power grab. To help mitigate this, the Executive doesn't get a representative, so there isn't a divisional "Tie-Breaker" on the committee. Also, having an even number of committee members fosters an atmosphere of consensus over votes.</li>
											<li>As a new Council begins, it's important that the Councillors review the <a href="http://www.starcitizenaces.org/forum/m/11393875/viewthread/11125369-conflict-committee-roster">Conflict Committee's roster</a>. Ensure that all the members are active and productive. ACES will need their help in our most difficult times.</li>
											<li>All Councillors inherit the committee member from the outgoing Councillor they're replacing. If a change is desired, a list of willing volunteers can be found in the <a href="http://www.starcitizenaces.org/forum/m/11393875/viewforum/3794042">Conflict Committee Sub-forum</a>. Typically, all potential Conflict Committee appointments are discussed via PM. Any Councillor can veto any nominee's appointment to the committee. Once a new Member has been allowed into the committee, contact an Admin to have the necessary tags added to the member, and have the Conflict Committee's roster edited.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li><span class="alphaOrderedListTitle">Diplomatic Committee</span><br>
										Comprised of the ambassadors of ACES, with one Director of Diplomacy to coordinate all information and carry out orders from the Executive Councillor. Deals with the diplomatic aspects of ACES, including managing the ambassadors of ACES, advising the Executive Councillor of the current Star Citizen community political climate, and maintaining a database of information on the different organizations we have relations with.
									</li>
									<li><span class="alphaOrderedListTitle">Recruitment Committee</span><br>
										Comprised of various recruiters with one Director of Recruitment to manage its activities and carry out orders from the council. Essentially the PR wing of ACES, the recruitment committee ensures ACES maintains a good public image, avoids bad press, and attempts to increase recruitment numbers to meet quotas set by the council.

										<li>Council Votes make up the bulk of votes Councillors participate in. These votes comprise ACES's legislation, and manage everything about ACES not included in the Constitution.</li>
										<li>To bring an idea up for a Council Vote, simply make a thread in the Council forum section, and use the "Open Council Vote" thread label. DON'T USE THE POLL FEATURE. It is important that members know who voted for what, and that admins haven't participated in the vote. Use this thread to discuss the thoughts for and against the proposal.</li>
										<li>When each individual Councillor has reached a decision on the topic, they can post their vote. When either side of the proposal reaches 4 votes, the legislation is either passed or defeated. Councillors are free to change their vote until the matter is decided. After this point, the entire matter must be reviewed, and a new vote must be taken to overturn the previous vote.</li>
										<li>Any Council Decisions should be posted in the <a href="http://www.starcitizenaces.org/forum/m/11393875/viewthread/7131235-council-decisions">Council Decisions</a> thread, along with a summary of the decision, and a link to the thread with the vote. An announcement should also be posted, alerting members to the decision.</li>
										<li>Prior to voting on any proposed change that directly affects ACES members, there shall be a 48 hour period in which the council shall discuss the motion (This is the minimum time period, more time can be taken if needed). During this time, a countdown will be placed in the proposal's original post, a global announcement made, and the councilor making the proposition should respond to any questions received via PM or otherwise within the 48 hour time period.</li>
										<li>Councillors can vote as soon as they wish, but the proposal if passed will not go into effect until 48 hours after it is posted.  in a time-sensitive situation an exception can be made to this rule by tagging [urgent] to the title of the proposal.</li>

										<li>Once all points of view have chimed in, the wording has been reviewed, and there's a reasonable chance the amendment will pass, have an Admin activate the Voting Booth forum section. Place a thread in the Voting Booth with the exact wording and placement of the amendment. Include a poll with the options, "I Approve This Amendment" and "I DO NOT Approve This Amendment". Leave the poll open for 2 weeks. Make a site announcement, and have an Admin PM the members to alert them to the fact that an amendment is being voted on.</li>
										<li>After 2 weeks, if the amendment has less than 75% approval, it is defeated. If the amendment has 75% or more approval, it is enacted and an Admin should add it to the Constitution.</li>

The only people allowed in the trial's channel are Councillors, Conflict Committee members, the defendant, and a witness currently testifying. No one else should be admitted to reduce distractions. All trial procedure should be recorded.</li>
										<li>All parties should be cognizant of the recording throughout the proceedings. The trial should start of with all Councillors identifying themselves, along with the defendant, so listeners know who is who. The Council will walk through the infraction, and all the evidence supporting it. The defendant will be allowed to refute any evidence as they go. All evidence should be explained in a way that allows listeners to easily follow the trial. Links to as much evidence as possible should be listed after the trial to aide listeners. Once the evidence against the defendant is presented, the defendant will begin presenting evidence showing their innocence, in the same manner.</li>
										<li>Once there is no more evidence to be presented, the Council will deliberate among themselves over what should be done. This session is not recorded.</li>

Subsequent terms have less value given that the first term will be the hardest to obtain since the member needs to obtain enough recognition within ACES to be elected. This first term as councilor should therefore be recognized with a higher value the first time around.</td>

Members who have 500 Forum posts are eligible for this award, but must be approved by the council by majority vote to ensure that it is not the result of spamming.</td>

										<td>15</td>
										<td>This award will be an incentive to make the Forums a more vibrant place and foster the democratic exchange of ideas. The more ideas and contributors the more likely we are to adopt better ideas. It also fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among members (yes joke threads do count as they make for a better community). The number of 500 may seem high but we should give members a high number to strive for and I envision Star Citizen to have a long run, so as the years go by, 500 posts is a reasonable base.</td>
